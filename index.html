<div class="title">About us<br></div><br>
<div class="body">We are a company right out of Raleigh, North Carolina. We started this business because we wanted our town and our state to have a bike shop where they can find what they need easily with no strings attached. 
We have a lot o different stores here to get bike gear, but it would take all day long trying to run around and get what we need! Instead of specializing in just one thing, we wanted to specialize in everything.
This means including custom work, materials, pre-made bikes of all kinds of big name brands, and magazines for those who want to learn more about their hobby.
